# Test Automation Framework

This is a **Java-based Test Automation Framework**.

The framework is built using Java 11, TestNG, Maven, and integrates with cloud-based testing on **LambdaTest**. It supports data-driven testing and generates detailed reports and logs.

## Setup Instruction

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/KapilPatil0408/cloud-selenium-framework
  cd cloud-selenium-framework
```

**Running tests on LambdaTest:**

```bash
  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X
```

**Running tests on chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless mode:**

```bash
  mvn test -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X
```

## Reports & Logs
- Reports: After test execution, an HTML report will be generated in the root folder as: ./reports.html. 

The Report contains information on the test results, including: Test summary, Pass/Fail counts, Execution duration, Logs and screenshots.

## Logs:
